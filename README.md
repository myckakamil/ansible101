# Ansible for DevOps - Learning Repository
https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops/c/CTVMPCbEeXd3
A hands-on learning repository for mastering Ansible, following the concepts and examples from the book "Ansible for DevOps" by [Jeff Geerling](https://www.youtube.com/@JeffGeerling). This repository contains my playbooks, inventory files, roles, and notes as I progress through the book and experiment with Ansible's capabilities.
